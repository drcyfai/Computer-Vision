# Computer-Vision
This is written for the 1st class project. Using OpenCV, one can stitch two images together.
There are three *.py files:
1. 5thCV_ClassicCV_Project1_ImageStitching_*.py is an independent file saved from jupyter notebook that can stitch two images together.
2. main.py and ImageStitch.py are python files that run image stitching. We defined two classes in ImageStitch.py and you need to import ImageStitch.py in order to run main.py.
   To run main.py file in the command line, as an example, you can input the following:
   $ python main.py original_image_left.jpg original_image_right.jpg
